# Cell_Tracking_Analysis3D
code to analyze 3D Cell Tracks in dense tissue, established during the Bachelor thesis of Mohamad Saibah. Other contributers: JÃ¼rgen Lippoldt, Steffen Grosser 

Collection of the code used for analysis of 3D cell tracking data. A detailed description is in the Bachelor thesis of Mohamad Saibah. The code requires bioformats_package(https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/), Mesh_voxelisation(https://github.com/davidstutz/mesh-voxelization), Skeleton3D(https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43400-skeleton3d)
